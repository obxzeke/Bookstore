# Bookstore
Project for Introduction to Computer Science II.
The idea behind this project is to design a system that allows a bookstore owner to keep track of their inventory and members.
The project uses inheritance and abstraction to create items (objects) that users can add to their cart and purchase.
There are multiple functions like adding items to carts, adding a new member, keep track of inventory of items and sorting the products by price.
